## Issues

### Submit an Issue
IHE welcomes [New Issues](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.Scheduling/issues/new/choose) from the GitHub community. 
For those without GitHub access, issues can be submitted to the [PCC Public Comment form](https://www.ihe.net/PCC_Public_Comments/).

As issues are submitted they will be managed on the [ITI.Scheduling GitHub Issues](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.Scheduling/issues), where discussion and workarounds can be found. These issues, when critical, will be processed using the normal [IHE Change Proposal](https://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Category:CPs) management and balloting. 
It is important to note that as soon as a Change Proposal is approved, it carries the same weight as a published Implementation Guide (i.e., it is testable at an [IHE Connectathon](https://www.ihe.net/participate/connectathon/) from the time it is approved, even if it will not be integrated until several months later).

#### Open Issues

* ITI-Scheduling-001: `$book` only, or `$book` and `$modify`? The current approach is to provide three distinct uses for the `$book` operation. See the [`$book` operation](./OperationDefinition-appointment-book.html) for details.
* ITI-Scheduling-002: Should there be a named option for supporting the [Appointment Hold \[ITI-16\]](./ITI-116.html) transaction?
* ITI-Scheduling-003: Should there be a named option for supporting the [Find Existing Appointments \[ITI-18\]](./ITI-118.html) transaction?
