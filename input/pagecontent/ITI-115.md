This section corresponds to transaction [ITI-115] of the IHE Technical Framework. Transaction [ITI-115] is used by the Scheduling Client and Scheduling Server Actors. The Find Appointments [ITI-115] transaction is used to provide a set of parameters to the server, and based on them to get back a list of possible appointments.

#### Scope

The Find Potential Appointments [ITI-115] transaction allows a Scheduling Client to retrieve a list of available slots for potential appointments from a Scheduling Server based on certain search critera.

### Actors Roles

**Table: Actor Roles**

|Actor | Role |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| [Scheduling Client](volume-1.html#client)    | Sends a "Find Potential Appointments" request to Server |
| [Scheduling Server](volume-1.html#server) | Receives and processes the "Find Potential Appointments" request and responds with 0, 1 or more potential appointment slots |

**Figure: Find Potential Appointments Interactions**

#### Find Potential Appointments request
This transaction uses the `$find`` operation as defined in the [Operation Definition](http://fhir.org/if/ihe/ITI.Scheduling/OperationDefinition/appointment-find).


#### Message Semantics
This transaction uses either the HTTP GET or POST method on the target Scheduling Server FHIR Appointment endpoint to convey the search criteria.

#### Message Semantics

**Example: GET**
`[base]/Appointment/$find?{parameters}`

**Example: POST**
`[base]/Appointment/$find`

##### Trigger Events

When a Scheduling Client needs to needs to find potential slot to book a new appointment it issues a "Find Potential Appointments" request.

##### Message Semantics
The Find Potential Appoinment request is defined as [FHIR Operation](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/operations.html). 

''TODO: create and reference the OperationDefinition''

###### Request parameters

The request parameters in the table below are derived from search parameters defined for a [FHIR Appointment Resource](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/appointment.html#search)

''TODO: discuss the Organzation parameter. A FHIR Appointment Resource does not include an Organization reference. Hence, it may not be possible to use it as a search parameter. Since a location is always linked to an organization '' 

|Use|Name|Card.|Type|Binding|Description|
|---|----|-----|----|-------|-----------|
|IN|start|0..1|dateTime|none|The period of time that should be checked for appointment availability.- e.g., look for all available appointments in a certain date range. If no start date is provided, all available appointments prior to the end date are in scope (subject to limits imposed by local business rules).|
|IN|end|0..1|dateTime|none|The period of time that should be checked for appointment availability.- e.g., look for all available appointments in a certain date range. If no end date is provided, all available appointments after the start date are in scope (subject to limits imposed by local business rules).|
|IN|specialty|0..*|token|see Note 1 in Expected Actions|The specialty of a practitioner that would be required to perform the service requested in this appointment (e.g., 'Dermatology'). If multiple specialties are listed, the order will interpreted as the order of preference. The response will contain appointments with any of these specialites. (i.e. this does not drive joint appointment with multiple actors). Each parameter value SHALL contain both the system property and the code property for a code using the general syntax specialty=[system]&vert;[code].|
|IN|appointmentType|0..*|token|see Note 2 in Expected Actions|The type of appointment.|
|IN|practitioner|0..*|reference|none|A reference to a (list of) practitioner(s) who need to participate in the appointment. Practitioners are preferably referenced by an identifier such as a NPI or other assigning authority. Identifier should be included as practitioner.identifier=[system]&vert;[value].|
|IN|organization|0..*|reference|none|A reference to zero or more preferred organizations where the appointment can take place. Preferably organization are reference by an identifier such as a NPI or other assigning authority. Identifier should be included as organization.identifier=[system]&vert;[value].|
|IN|location|0..*|reference|none|A reference to zero or more preferred locations where the appointment can take place.|
|IN|service-category|0..1|token|see Note 3 in Expected Actions|A broad categorization of the service that is to be performed during this appointment|
|IN|service-type|0..1|token|See Note 4 in Expected Actions|The specific service that is to be performed during this appointment|

**Example: GET**
In case the Scheduling Client uses a GET method it the search parameters are added to the request URL like:

`[base]/Appointment/$find?practioner.identifier=urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.4.6|1234567&start=2023-10-30&end=2023-11-30`

**Example: POST**
In case the Scheduling Client uses a POST method it is expected to add the search parameters to the request payload like:

```
POST  [base]/Appointment/$find

{
    "resourceType": "Parameters",
    "parameter": [{
        "name": "start",
        "valueDateTime" : "2017-07-15T20:00:00Z"
    },
    {
        "name": "end",
        "valueDateTime" : "2017-07-17T20:00:00Z"
    },
    {
        "name": "practitioner.identifier",
        "valueIdentifier: "urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.4.6|1234567"
    }]
}
```

##### Expected Actions

Binding to CodeSets and ValueSets are expected to be localized. In no localization is available the Scheduling Client is expected to use a code from the : 

Note 1: [Practice Setting Code ValueSet](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-c80-practice-codes.html).

Note 2: [Appointment Reason Code ValueSet](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/v2/0276/index.html).

Note 3: [Service Category ValueSet](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-service-category.html).

Note 4: [Service Type ValueSet](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-service-type.html).

The Scheduling Client shall support [FHIR Pagination](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#paging) when the Scheduling Server paginates its response.

#### Go Response Message

##### Trigger Events

Upon receiving a Find Potential Appointments request the Scheduling Server apply internal (business) logic to determine possible appointment (slots) that meet the search criteria specified by the Scheduling Client. The Scheduling Server returns a list of potential Appointment option the Scheduling Client can choose from to reserve or book an appointment.

##### Message Semantics

The list of potential appointments is returned as a FHIR Bundle of type ```searchset```is returned containing 0, 1 or more Appointment resffources 

''TODO: include IHE ITI Appointment Bundle Profile ''


##### Expected Actions
The Scheduling Server shall make a best effort to find potential Appointments. Each Appointment resource included in the response Bundle should me as complete as possible allowing the Scheduling Client to render the appointment information in such a way a (human) user is able to reserver or book an appointment.

The Scheduling Server shall honour the ```_count``` request parameter when included in the Find Appointments Query request by a Scheduling Client by limiting the number of potential appointments to match the ```_count``` value.

The Scheduling Server shall inclue a ```total``` attribute in the FHIR Bundle response indicating the total number of potential appointments it has determined. 

The Scheduling Server may use [pagination](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#paging) allowing a Scheduling Client to page through the results.

##### Error codes
In the absence of any processing errors a http 200 (OK) error code is returned

In case security or other constraints prevent a Scheduling Server from returning a response to the Scheduling Client a http 4xx error code is returned

**Table: Error Codes**

|Error Code | Description | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
|400 | Bad Request | The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error |
|401 | Unauthorized | The server cannot or will not process the request due to an authorization issue with the request |
|403 | Forbidden | The server cannot or will not process the request because the Scheduling Client (or a user) is not authorized for the request |
{: .grid}

The Scheduling Server may include an OperationOutcome to the response where it uses the values from the Error Codes table.

**Table: OperationOutcome Attributes**

|Attribute | Vaue | 
|----------|------|
| severity | Fatal |
| code | \<http error description\> |
| diagnostics | \<http error explanation\> |
